# Fileship Telemetry Module

Fileship collects telemetry data about general usage. This helps us to accurately gauge Fileship feature usage and customization across all our users.

This program is optional. You can always [opt-out](#opting-out) if you do not want to share any information.

### üîç AI Search Usage

- `projectId`: A unique, anonymous identifier for the Fileship instance.

- `results`: Number of results returned for the query.
- `duration`: Time taken for the search query to complete (in milliseconds/seconds).

**Important Note:** While `projectId` is an anonymous identifier for your Fileship instance and cannot be traced back to individual users, please be aware that the `query` field in `AI Search Usage` contains the actual search query text. Fileship aims to collect minimal data necessary for product improvement. No other personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.

## üîî Opting-out

Users can opt-out of telemetry data collection by setting the `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`. This will disable all telemetry data collection.
