# Fileship Telemetry Module

Fileship collects anonymous telemetry data about general usage. This helps us to accurately gauge Fileship feature usage and customization across all our users.

This program is optional. You can always [opt-out](#opting-out) if you do not want to share any information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Events

The following events are tracked by the telemetry module:

- `System Information`: Information about the user's system, including OS, CPU, and memory usage.
- `Fileship Information`: Information about the Fileship instance, including version and usage statistics.
- `AI Search Usage`: Information about the usage of the AI search feature, including query and result statistics.

## üîî Opting-out

Users can opt-out of telemetry data collection by setting the `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`. This will disable all telemetry data collection.
